# Getting Started

In the following sections we explain how to get started with Jane and explore some of its features. We assume that you have Jane up and [running](running.md) and that you can get to the web UI.

   * Overview of the UI
   * Creating an element
   * Loading the standard intents
   * Your first attestation
   * Creating and expected value
   * Verification
   * More attestation and verification

# Overview of the UI

Point your browser at the UI, eg: (http://127.0.0.1:8540) if you are running on a local machine on the default port. You should see something like this:

![Jane WebUI Home Page](images/janewebuihomepage.png "Jane WebUI Home Page")

This shows the overall status of the system. The upper part showing the contents of the database and the lower part the congfiguration of the system. In our example we can see that we have 1 element, 12 intents, 2 expected values etc. Clicking on the titles of these will take you to a page which shows these items in more detail.

The lower half shows the configuration: how janeserver was started and with what paratmers, what services are running and on what ports, the state of the MQTT messagebus, Mongo databaes and the logging file.

The top bar is available on all pages and clicking on the home icon on the left-hand side will always bring you back to this page.
